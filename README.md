Imagine that you own a small business or started a club (craft store, coffee shop, event planning, zumba club, etc). Now youâ€™re about to design and implement a single screen app that displays information about your small business!

    On the screen, you must show:
        Business name
        Details of the business
        Business address and hours (if applicable)
        Contact information (phone, email, website)
        Please show at least one image on the screen
    Make sure the UI supports adaptive design
        Support different mobile screen dimensions
        Support vertical (portrait) view as well as horizontal (landscape) view (when user rotates his/her phone, the view is adjusted automatically)
    (Bonus) Annotate your business address on map

    (Bonus) Implement mobile app for a real small business or real club. It can be the one you own or a one in your neighborhood (in this case make sure that you get written consent from the owner)
